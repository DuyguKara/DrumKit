# DrumKit
This is mini website game.

In this project, I try to learn some javascript concepts. I learned the object structure of Javascript and learned how to add an event listener to make the function I want run when an event occurs. I created a web page where the sounds of the drum parts shown in the picture are played by clicking or pressing the relevant key.

When you click or press the relevant key on the keyboard, you can hear the sound of the drum.
